            <h2>The Scammers of the Blogging World</h2>
            I’m noticing a trend in the blogging world that I really don’t like. It’s where all these people are jumping right into teaching people how to make money, but they haven’t actually done it themselves.

I’m sure you’ve seen it. It’s everywhere. People without any online business experience – never created a product or service, launched a course, built a social media following, or even thought about ROI – have put themselves in the spotlight to teach about these topics they know nothing about.
